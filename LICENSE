			Released under the respect the work of the original author license.
			-------------------------------------------------------------------
			
The source code for RomVault has been released for the benefit of the emulation community.
This means you should ask yourself if you make a change/improvement/branch of this code, does your changes
also benefit the emulation community? If so then please give back to the community in a respectful way.

What does giving back to the community in a respectful way mean:
	Ideally it means contribute your changes back to the author of the source, so that your changes can be worked into the main build.
	If you make a reasonably large change that you think others will benefit from put out your own branches for other people to try,
	and then maybe this can also be worked into the main code.
	
	It means DO NOT make a small change/fix, re-brand the program and claim you are the greatest developer ever for releasing 'your' software.
	This type of behaviour is disrespectful to the original author and the emulation community, and is against the nature of this license.
	
If you want to use large parts of this code (such as the DAT reader or torrentZip library) in your own project go right ahead, 
I hope you can do something cool with this code to add to or improve your new and existing projects. Please let the author know how you
are using it, it would be cool to hear about other things this is being used for. 

DO NOT sell this software or any derivative works from this software without permission from the author.
I have put 100's of hours of development into this code and only ever asked for donations to support this project.
So if you go and grab this code and start selling it or derivative works, that is disrespecting the nature of this license,
and so not permitted without permission.
